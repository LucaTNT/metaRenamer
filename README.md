# metaRenamer

## What is metaRenamer?
This script uses SublerCLI to rename video files according to their metadata.
As of now, it only support TV Shows and only with a fixed naming scheme, but this will be improved ASAP.
The intended use is to rename files that have been processed by iFlicks, which is quite good at interpreting the wacky naming schemes used by uploaders for their files
